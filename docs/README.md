## Quick Start

### Library Usage

```python
from nocturna_calculations import Chart

# Create a new chart
chart = Chart(
    date="2024-03-20",
    time="12:00:00",
    latitude=55.7558,
    longitude=37.6173
)

# Calculate planetary positions
positions = chart.calculate_planetary_positions()

# Calculate aspects
aspects = chart.calculate_aspects()
```

### API Usage (Direct)

```python
import requests

# API endpoint
url = "http://localhost:8000/api/charts/natal"

# Request data
data = {
    "date": "2024-03-20",
    "time": "12:00:00",
    "latitude": 55.7558,
    "longitude": 37.6173
}

# Make request with user token
response = requests.post(
    url,
    json=data,
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_USER_TOKEN"}
)

# Get results
chart_data = response.json()
```

### Service Integration (Backend-to-Backend)

```python
import requests

# Your main backend integrating with Nocturna service
class NocturnaClient:
    def __init__(self, api_url, service_token):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {service_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    
    def calculate_positions(self, chart_data):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.api_url}/api/v1/calculations/planetary-positions",
            headers=self.headers,
            json=chart_data
        )
        return response.json()

# Usage
client = NocturnaClient(
    api_url="http://nocturna-api:8000",
    service_token="your_30_day_service_token"
)

result = client.calculate_positions({
    "date": "2024-03-20",
    "time": "12:00:00",
    "latitude": 55.7558,
    "longitude": 37.6173
})
```

## Service Architecture Options

### Option 1: Standalone Library
Use Nocturna as a Python library directly in your application.

### Option 2: API Service
Deploy Nocturna as a REST API for multiple client applications.

### Option 3: Service Component (Recommended)
Deploy Nocturna as a **service component** that integrates with your main backend:

```
┌─────────────────┐    API calls    ┌──────────────────┐
│   Your Main     │◄──────────────►│  Nocturna API    │
│   Backend       │  (service token) │  (Calculations) │
│                 │                 │                  │
└─────────────────┘                 └──────────────────┘
         │                                   │
         ▼                                   ▼
┌─────────────────┐                 ┌──────────────────┐
│   Frontend      │                 │  PostgreSQL +    │
│   Application   │                 │  Redis           │
└─────────────────┘                 └──────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- **Separation of concerns** - your backend handles users, Nocturna handles calculations
- **Scalable** - can be deployed independently
- **Secure** - service token authentication
- **Maintainable** - clear API boundaries

## Token Management

When deployed as a service component, Nocturna uses **JWT service tokens** for backend authentication:

### Checking Token Status
```bash
make docker-token-check
```

### Renewing Tokens
```bash
# Automatic renewal (if expiring within 7 days)
make docker-token-renew

# Force renewal
make docker-token-force-renew

# Eternal token (for lazy admins with nginx protection!)
make docker-token-eternal

# Custom duration token
make docker-token-custom DAYS=365
```

### For Lazy Admins 😴
Generate **eternal tokens** that never expire (perfect for internal deployments):
```bash
make docker-token-eternal
```
**Requirements**: Nginx reverse proxy + firewall protection to block external access.

### Integration Monitoring
```python
# Monitor token expiration in your backend
def check_nocturna_token_health():
    days_left = check_token_expiration(SERVICE_TOKEN)
    if days_left is None:  # Eternal token
        return "♾️ Eternal token - no concerns!"
    elif days_left < 7:
        send_alert("Nocturna token expires soon!")
```
