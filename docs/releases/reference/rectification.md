# Rectification Methods

This document describes the rectification methods implemented in the Nocturna Calculations library.

## Overview

Rectification is the process of determining an accurate birth time when it is unknown or uncertain. The library implements several rectification methods, both traditional and modern.

## Single Event Rectification

### Event-Based Method

1. **Input Requirements**

   - Known event with exact time
   - Event description
   - Event location

2. **Calculation Process**
   - Generate charts for time window
   - Calculate relevant directions
   - Compare with event timing
   - Score potential times

3. **Scoring System**
   - Aspect strength
   - House emphasis
   - Direction timing
   - Overall configuration

### Pattern-Based Method

1. **Pattern Types**
   - Planetary configurations
   - House emphasis
   - Aspect patterns
   - Special points

2. **Analysis Steps**
   - Identify key patterns
   - Calculate pattern timing
   - Compare with events
   - Score matches

## Multiple Events Rectification
