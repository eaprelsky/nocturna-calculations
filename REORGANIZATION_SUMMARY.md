# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the Nocturna Calculations project to implement clear environment management and improve developer experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Structure
**Previous**: Single environment (`nocturna`)
**New**: Three purpose-specific environments

| Environment | Name | Python | Purpose |
|-------------|------|--------|---------|
| Development | `nocturna-dev` | 3.11 | Daily development, debugging |
| Testing | `nocturna-test` | 3.9 | Testing, benchmarks, QA |
| Production | `nocturna-prod` | 3.11 | Deployment, minimal deps |

### 2. File Organization

#### New Directory Structure
```

### 4. Automation Tools

#### Makefile Commands
```bash
# Environment Management
make setup-dev              # Setup development environment
make setup-test             # Setup testing environment
make setup-prod             # Setup production environment
make switch-env ENV=dev      # Switch environments
make list-env               # List environments
make validate-env           # Validate current environment

# Development
make dev-server             # Start development server
make jupyter                # Start Jupyter Lab
make dev-shell              # Interactive Python shell

# Testing
make test                   # Run full test suite
make benchmark              # Run benchmarks
make quality                # Code quality checks

# Maintenance
make clean                  # Clean artifacts
make update-deps            # Update dependencies
make health-check           # System health check
```
